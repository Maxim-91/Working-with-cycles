How the program works: Find friendly numbers between "a" and "b". Friendly numbers according to Pythagoras are such that each is equal to the sum of all divisors of the other, except for the third of this number. For example, 220 and 284. The divisors of 220 are 1+2+4+5+10+11+20+22+44+55+110=284, and the sum of the divisors of 284 is 1+2+4+71+ 142=220.
